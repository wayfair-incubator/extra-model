# Documentation

* Documentation is written in markdown format and files are kept in the `/docs` directory in the project root.
* API documentation is auto-generated by the `mkdocstrings` package. An example of this can be seen in the `reference.md` file.
* New files must be added to the table of context in `/mkdocs.yml`.

## Develop

1. Make changes on a development branch

1. Run the following command to render and serve documentation locally

        docker-compose run --rm --service-ports mkdocs

1. Visit the local documentation to see your changes while developing  
    **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**  
  
1. Push this branch, get approval and merge to the `main` branch

## Publish

> **NOTE**: This requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed on your
machine and you to be authenticated against GitHub (for example via [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)).

1. Pull down the `gh-pages` branch. This only needs to be done once
