### Using docker-compose

First, build the image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Then, run following command to make sure that `extra-model` was installed correctly:

```bash
docker-compose run test
```

#### Downloading Embeddings

Next step is to download the embeddings (we use [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) from Stanford in this project).

To download the required embeddings, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm setup
```

The embeddings will be downloaded, unzipped and formatted into a space-efficient format. Files will be saved in the `embeddings/` directory in the root of the project directory. If the process fails, it can be safely restarted. If you want to restart the process with new files, delete all files except `README.md` in the `embeddings/` directory.

#### [Optional] Run `docker-compose build` again

After you've downloaded the embeddings, you may want to run `docker-compose build` again. 
This will build an image with embeddings already present inside the image. 

The tradeoff here is that the image will be much bigger, but you won't spend ~2 minutes each time you run `extra-model` waiting for embeddings to be mounted into the container.
On the other hand, building an image with embeddings in the context will increase build time from ~3 minutes to ~10 minutes.

#### Run `extra-model`

Finally, running `extra-model` is as simple as:

```bash
docker-compose run extra-model /package/tests/resources/100_comments.csv
```

NOTE: when using this approach, input file should be mounted inside the container.
By default, everything from `extra-model` folder will be mounted to `/package/` folder.
This can be changed in `docker-compose.yaml`

This will produce a `result.csv` file in `/io/` (default setting) folder.

There are multiple options that you can set to change how `extra-model` runs.

The best way to see them is by running `docker-compose run extra-model --help`

This will produce following output:

```bash
‚ùØ docker-compose run extra-model --help
Usage: extra-model [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

  Run the Extra algorithm for unsupervised topic extraction.

  INPUT_PATH (required) is the path to the input csv file with the user
  generated texts. It must contain `CommentId` and `Comments` columns that are
  spelled exactly this way.

  OUTPUT_PATH (option) is the path to the output directory. Default is `/io`.

  OUTPUT_FILENAME (option) is the filename of the output file. Default is
  `result.csv`. The `.csv` file extension is not enforced. Please take care of
  this accordingly.

  EMBEDDINGS_PATH (option) is the path where the extra model will load the
  embeddings from. defaults to `/embeddings`.

Options:
  -op, --output-path PATH      [default: /io]
  -of, --output-filename PATH  [default: result.csv]
  -ep, --embeddings-path PATH  [default: /embeddings]
  --debug                      Enable debug logging
  --help                       Show this message and exit.

```

### Using command line

#### Install `extra-model`

First, install `extra-model` via pip:

```bash
pip install extra-model
```

Then, add all the external dependencies:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m nltk.downloader wordnet punkt omw-1.4
```

#### Downloading Embeddings

Next, run the following to download and set up the required embeddings (we use [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) from Stanford in this project):

```bash
extra-model-setup
```

The embeddings will be downloaded, unzipped and formatted into a space-efficient format and saved in `/embeddings`.
The location can be changed by providing path:

```bash
extra-model-setup /path/to/store/embeddings
```

If the process fails, it can be safely restarted. If you want to restart the process with new files, delete all files except `README.md` in the embeddings' directory.

#### Run `extra-model`

Once set up, running `extra-model` is as simple as:

```bash
extra-model /path/to/file.csv 
```

Your file must contain `CommentId` and `Comments` columns. Learn more about input/output [here](https://wayfair-incubator.github.io/extra-model/site/#extra-model-input).

This will produce a `result.csv` file in `/io`. Both paths (and embeddings location) can be changed.
Learn more on how to do this by running:

```bash
extra-model --help
```

### Using as a Python package

#### Install `extra-model`

First, install `extra-model` via pip:

```bash
pip install extra-model
```

Then, add all the external dependencies:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m nltk.downloader wordnet punkt omw-1.4
```

#### Downloading Embeddings

Next, use either the `extra-model-setup` CLI or `docker-compose` to download and set up the required embeddings (we use [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) from Stanford in this project):

```bash
extra-model-setup
```

or

```bash
docker-compose run --rm setup
```


The embeddings will be downloaded, unzipped and formatted into a space-efficient format. 
For the Docker based workflow, the embeddings will be saved to the `embeddings` directory. 
For the CLI workflow, by default, files will be saved in `/embeddings`. 
You can set another directory by providing it as an argument when running `extra-model-setup` like so:

```bash
extra-model-setup /path/to/store/embeddings
```


If the process fails, it can be safely restarted. If you want to restart the process with new files, delete all files except `README.md` in the embeddings' directory.

#### Use `extra-model` as a Python package

Once set up, you can use `extra-model` by calling the `run()` function in `extra_model/_run.py` :

```python
from extra_model._run import run
from pathlib import Path

run(
    input_path=Path("/input/path/file.csv"),
    output_path=Path("/output/path")
)
```

This will process `/input/path` and produce a `result.csv` file in `/output/path`. 
If you want to change the output filename to be something different from `result.csv`, you can do os by providing an 
additional argument to `run()`:

```python
from extra_model._run import run
from pathlib import Path

run(
    input_path=Path("/input/path"),
    output_path=Path("/output/path"),
    output_filename=Path("output_filename.csv")
)
```

You can use `run_from_dataframe` function from `extra_model/_run.py`  to use `extra-model` with dataframe 

```python
from extra_model._run import run_from_dataframe
from pathlib import Path

df = pd.DataFrame(
        data=[[1, "test comment"], [2, "test comment 2"]],
        columns=["CommentId", "Comments"],
    )
results = run_from_dataframe(df)
```
Inputs/outputs are documented [here](https://wayfair-incubator.github.io/extra-model/site/#extra-model-input)
