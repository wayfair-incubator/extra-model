<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how you can leverage <code>ExtRA</code> output for your analysis.</p>
<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>The sentiment result for each comment includes: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Aspect</code>: extracted nouns from the comment.</li>
<li><code>Topic</code>: semantic grouping of aspects, e.g. actual nouns that people might have used are "heater" and "radiator". ExtRA will aggregate them together into a topic (e.g., "heating.n.01"). This way you get to see all comments that are about all sorts of heaters (and you can ignore the ".n.01" at the end - this refers to different meanings a word can have. <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=work&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=&amp;o7=&amp;o5=1&amp;o9=&amp;o6=1&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h=10000">wordnet dictionary</a>).</li>
<li><code>Descriptor</code>: adjective that was used next to an aspect.</li>
<li><code>AdCluster</code>: similar to how we use wordnet to roll up multiple aspects into one, adjective cluster is a way to group similar adjective into one cluster. For example, “good” and “Great” will be combined to “nice”. This reduces dimensionality and makes reasoning slightly easier.</li>
<li><code>SentimentCompound</code>: sentiment of an adjective. However, this sentiment is not always reliable, so it should be thought of as an indication, rather than an accurate indicator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report only analyses the comments that are in English.</p>

<h2 id="aspect-view">Aspect View</h2>
<p>This word map demonstrates what have been talked about and their respective sentiment.</p>
<p>Notes: to increase visibility only aspects with <code>count_aspect &gt; 2</code> &amp; <code>sentiment_compound ≠ 0</code> are included in the map; the higher the aspect is located, the more often it is mentioned. <br>
