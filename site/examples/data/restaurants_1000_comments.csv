Wow... Loved this place.,1
Crust is not good.,2
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,3
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.,4
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,5
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,6
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),7
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,8
The fries were great too.,9
A great touch.,10
Service was very prompt.,11
Would not go back.,12
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,13
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!",14
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,15
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,16
Highly recommended.,17
Waitress was a little slow in service.,18
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.",19
did not like at all.,20
The Burrittos Blah!,21
"The food, amazing.",22
Service is also cute.,23
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.,24
So they performed.,25
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,26
- They never brought a salad we asked for.,27
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.",28
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.",29
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,30
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.",31
This was like the final blow!,32
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.,33
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",34
"Overall, I like this place a lot.",35
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,36
Ample portions and good prices.,37
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.",38
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,39
Service sucks.,40
The shrimp tender and moist.,41
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,42
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,43
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.",44
"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.",45
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,46
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,47

If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!,49
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.",50
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,51

"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.",54
The portion was huge!,55
"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.",56
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,57
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,58
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.",59
"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.",60
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,61
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,62
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,63
We'd definitely go back here again.,64
We are so glad we found this place.,65
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.",66
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,67
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,68
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,69
A great way to finish a great.,70
"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.",71
"- Really, really good rice, all the time.",72
The service was meh.,73
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.",74
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.",75
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,76
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !,77
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,78
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,79
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,80
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,81
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,82
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,83
This place has it!,84
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,85
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,86
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,87
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,88
Omelets are to die for!,89
Everything was fresh and delicious!,90

Penne vodka excellent!,132

The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,142
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,143
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,144
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,145
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,146
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",147
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.",148
I give it 2 thumbs down,149
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,150
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,151
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.,152
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,153
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,154
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!,155
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,156
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,157
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,158

Avoid at all cost!,164
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.,165
DELICIOUS!!,166

I've never been treated so bad.,169
Bacon is hella salty.,170
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.",171

The waitresses are very friendly.,173
"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!",174
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,175
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.",176
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,177
"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.",178
"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.",179
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,180
"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.",181
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,182
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,183
It was probably dirt.,184
"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.",185

Soggy and not good.,217
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,218
Which are small and not worth the price.,219
- the food is rich so order accordingly.,220
"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!",221
The service was a bit lacking.,222
"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.",223

Very very fun chef.,233
"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.",234
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.,235
"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.",236
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.",237
"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).",238
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,239
"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.",240
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.,241

"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.",244
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.""",245
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,246
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks.",247
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.,248
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.,249
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.,250
Owner's are really great people.!,251
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.,252
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,253

Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,255
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,256

Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.,287
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.,288

I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.,298
Never again will I be dining at this place!,299
The food was excellent and service was very good.,300
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.,301
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.,302

"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.",318
"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.",319
All the bread is made in-house!,320
The only downside is the service.,321

Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.,323
"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.",324
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!,325
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!,326
You won't be disappointed.,327

"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.",329

There is nothing authentic about this place.,340
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,341

Pretty good beer selection too.,346

(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.),360
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.,361
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.,362
Pretty cool I would say.,363
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.,364
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.,365
"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.",366
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.,367
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.,368
"The staff are great, the ambiance is great.",369
He deserves 5 stars.,370
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,371
They dropped more than the ball.,372
"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.",373
"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!",374
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.,375
Best tacos in town by far!!,376
I took back my money and got outta there.,377
"In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.",378
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.,379

I won't be back.,381
They have great dinners.,382
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.,383

I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.,386
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,387
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,388
This is a disgrace.,389
Def coming back to bowl next time,390

I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.,392
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.",393
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.,394
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.,395
"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.",396
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.,397
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!,398
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.,399
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.,400
This one is simply a disappointment.,401

I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!,403
"Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.",404
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.,405
Left very frustrated.,406
I'll definitely be in soon again.,407

TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,410

"For service, I give them no stars.",413
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.,414
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.,415
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).,416
But now I was completely grossed out.,417
I really enjoyed eating here.,418
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.,419
"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.",420
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.,421
"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.",422
"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!",423
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.,424
What a mistake that was!,425
No complaints!,426
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.,427
Waiter was a jerk.,428

These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.,430
I never come again.,431
We loved the biscuits!!!,432
Service is quick and friendly.,433
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.,434
So absolutley fantastic.,435
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.,436
definitely will come back here again.,437
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.,438

I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,823
The cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist.,824
Awful service.,825

Food quality has been horrible.,827
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,828

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,872

Seriously killer hot chai latte.,889
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.",890
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,891
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,892
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,893
Worst Thai ever.,894
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,895
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,896
The pizza selections are good.,897
"I had strawberry tea, which was good.",898
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,899

Spend your money elsewhere.,901
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,902
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,903
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!",904
-My order was not correct.,905
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",906
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,907
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,908
We won't be returning.,909
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,910
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,911
"Very, very sad.",912
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",913
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",914
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,915
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.,916
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",917
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,918
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,919
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.",920
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.",921
This place is disgusting!,922
"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.",923
The RI style calamari was a joke.,924
"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.",925
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",926
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.",927
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,928
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,929
Disappointing experience.,930
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.",931
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",932
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,933
We won't be going back.,934
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,935
This place lacked style!!,936
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.",937
Don't bother coming here.,938
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.",939
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.",940
It was equally awful.,941
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,942
very slow at seating even with reservation.,943
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,944
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,945
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.",946

I was VERY disappointed!!,948
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,949
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",950
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,951
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,952
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.",953
Con: spotty service.,954
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",955
But then they came back cold.,956
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",957
The real disappointment was our waiter.,958
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,959
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,960
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.",961
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,962
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,963
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,964
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,965
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,966
But I don't like it.,967
Hell no will I go back,968
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,969
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all"".",970
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,971
The ambiance isn't much better.,972
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.",973
The food wasn't good.,974

I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,979
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.",980
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.",981
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,982
Food was below average.,983
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,984
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.",985
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,986
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,987

It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,989
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,990

Spend your money and time some place else.,992
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,993
the presentation of the food was awful.,994
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,995
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,996
Appetite instantly gone.,997
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,998
"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.",999
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.",1000
